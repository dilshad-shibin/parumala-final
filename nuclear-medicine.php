                                <p>Nuclear Medicine is a branch of medicine that makes use of radioactive medicines for diagnosis and treatment of diseases. Small dose of radioactive medicine is introduced into the body (oral route or by injections) and functions of various organs in the body can be imaged.Relatively larger doses of radioactive medicines are used for treatment. It mainly includes treatment for hyper functioning thyroid gland, thyroid cancer, treatment of bone pain, treatment of certain types of cancer like neuroendocrine tumors and prostate cancer. Diagnostic scans and treatment in nuclear medicine is very safe painless and comfortable. Comprehensive nuclear medicine dept includes facilities like gamma camera, PET/CT, low dose and high dose radionuclide therapy and thyroid cancer clinic. All these facilities are available at SGICCC Parumala at reasonable cost. The nuclear medicine department at St Gregorios International cancer cancer care centre is the first comprehensive nuclear medicine department in central Travancore.</p>

                            <h2><strong>PET-CT</strong></h2>
                            <p class="mb-3">The Department of Nuclear Medicine is equipped with the state-of-the-art 16 slice GE Discovery IQ PET-CT scanner (Positron Emission Tomography - Computed Tomography) from GE USA, the first of its kind in the central Travancore. It provides precise diagnostic information in patients with cancer, heart disease and certain neurologic conditions. In addition to 18F-FDG, the department offers the facility to do PET/CT with a number of tracers labeled with 68Ga like 68Ga DOTATATE for neuroendocrine tumors, 68Ga PSMA for prostate cancer, 68Ga Exendin IV for insulinomas, 68Ga Ubi for infection imaging etc.</p>
                            <h2><strong>Gamma Camera</strong></h2>
                            <p>The department is equipped with a gamma camera with SPECT facility (GE Brivo NM 615). Nuclear Medicine imaging using gamma camera is utilized to image functional / metabolic processes in various organs in the body. Unlike computed tomography (CT) or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) which are anatomic / morphological imaging, nuclear medicine imaging provides insight into functional aspects of various organs in the body. In most diseases, functional changes precede anatomic changes, so scintigraphic evidence of a disease process can be diagnosed at an earlier stage. Nuclear medicine procedures done using a gamma camera are usually non invasive and safe with a small amount of radiation exposure which is very well comparable with diagnostic radiology procedures.</p>
